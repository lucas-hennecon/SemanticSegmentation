# UNet for Semantic Segmentation

This project implements a **UNet architecture** for **semantic segmentation**, trained on the **Cityscape dataset** to classify each pixel into categories like roads, buildings, and vehicles.

## 📜 Summary
The UNet model is a powerful encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections, enabling precise segmentation. It was trained and evaluated on the Cityscape dataset, widely used for urban scene understanding tasks.
