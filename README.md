# UNet for Semantic Segmentation

This project implements a **UNet architecture** for **semantic segmentation**, trained on the **Cityscape dataset** to classify each pixel into categories like roads, buildings, and vehicles...

## ðŸ“œ Summary
The UNet model is a powerful encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections, enabling precise segmentation. It was trained and evaluated on the Cityscape dataset, widely used for urban scene understanding tasks.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
- **`train/`**: Contains the training dataset (Cityscape images and ground truth masks).
- **`val/`**: Contains the validation dataset (Cityscape images and ground truth masks).
- **`UNet_Semantic_Segmentation.ipynb`**: Main notebook with the UNet implementation, training, and evaluation.
